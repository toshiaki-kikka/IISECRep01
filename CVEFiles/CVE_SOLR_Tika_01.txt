CVE-2022-33879	2022-06-27	2022-10-28	3.3	0.02%			The initial fixes in CVE-2022-30126 and CVE-2022-30973 for regexes in the StandardsExtractingContentHandler were insufficient, and we found a separate, new regex DoS in a different regex in the StandardsExtractingContentHandler. These are now fixed in 1.28.4 and 2.4.1.
CVE-2022-30973	2022-05-31	2022-10-27	5.5	0.16%			We failed to apply the fix for CVE-2022-30126 to the 1.x branch in the 1.28.2 release. In Apache Tika, a regular expression in the StandardsText class, used by the StandardsExtractingContentHandler could lead to a denial of service caused by backtracking on a specially crafted file. This only affects users who are running the StandardsExtractingContentHandler, which is a non-standard handler. This is fixed in 1.28.3.
CVE-2022-30126	2022-05-16	2022-10-19	5.5	1.28%			In Apache Tika, a regular expression in our StandardsText class, used by the StandardsExtractingContentHandler could lead to a denial of service caused by backtracking on a specially crafted file. This only affects users who are running the StandardsExtractingContentHandler, which is a non-standard handler. This is fixed in 1.28.2 and 2.4.0
CVE-2022-25169	2022-05-16	2022-11-09	5.5	0.06%			The BPG parser in versions of Apache Tika before 1.28.2 and 2.4.0 may allocate an unreasonable amount of memory on carefully crafted files.
CVE-2021-33813	2021-06-16	2023-02-28	7.5	0.07%		Potential	An XXE issue in SAXBuilder in JDOM through 2.0.6 allows attackers to cause a denial of service via a crafted HTTP request.
CVE-2021-28657	2021-03-31	2022-05-10	5.5	0.25%			A carefully crafted or corrupt file may trigger an infinite loop in Tika's MP3Parser up to and including Tika 1.25. Apache Tika users should upgrade to 1.26 or later.
CVE-2020-9489	2020-04-27	2022-10-07	5.5	1.07%			A carefully crafted or corrupt file may trigger a System.exit in Tika's OneNote Parser. Crafted or corrupted files can also cause out of memory errors and/or infinite loops in Tika's ICNSParser, MP3Parser, MP4Parser, SAS7BDATParser, OneNoteParser and ImageParser. Apache Tika users should upgrade to 1.24.1 or later. The vulnerabilities in the MP4Parser were partially fixed by upgrading the com.googlecode:isoparser:1.1.22 dependency to org.tallison:isoparser:1.9.41.2. For unrelated security reasons, we upgraded org.apache.cxf to 3.3.6 as part of the 1.24.1 release.
CVE-2020-1951	2020-03-23	2022-10-07	5.5	0.41%			A carefully crafted or corrupt PSD file can cause an infinite loop in Apache Tika's PSDParser in versions 1.0-1.23.
CVE-2020-1950	2020-03-23	2022-10-07	5.5	0.56%			A carefully crafted or corrupt PSD file can cause excessive memory usage in Apache Tika's PSDParser in versions 1.0-1.23.
CVE-2019-10094	2019-08-02	2020-08-24	7.8	0.55%			A carefully crafted package/compressed file that, when unzipped/uncompressed yields the same file (a quine), causes a StackOverflowError in Apache Tika's RecursiveParserWrapper in versions 1.7-1.21. Apache Tika users should upgrade to 1.22 or later.
CVE-2019-10093	2019-08-02	2020-08-24	6.5	1.45%			In Apache Tika 1.19 to 1.21, a carefully crafted 2003ml or 2006ml file could consume all available SAXParsers in the pool and lead to very long hangs. Apache Tika users should upgrade to 1.22 or later.
CVE-2019-10088	2019-08-02	2020-08-24	8.8	1.01%			A carefully crafted or corrupt zip file can cause an OOM in Apache Tika's RecursiveParserWrapper in versions 1.7-1.21. Users should upgrade to 1.22 or later.
CVE-2018-17197	2018-12-24	2019-10-03	6.5	2.96%			A carefully crafted or corrupt sqlite file can cause an infinite loop in Apache Tika's SQLite3Parser in versions 1.8-1.19.1 of Apache Tika.
CVE-2018-11796	2018-10-09	2019-09-03	7.5	2.51%			In Apache Tika 1.19 (CVE-2018-11761), we added an entity expansion limit for XML parsing. However, Tika reuses SAXParsers and calls reset() after each parse, which, for Xerces2 parsers, as per the documentation, removes the user-specified SecurityManager and thus removes entity expansion limits after the first parse. Apache Tika versions from 0.1 to 1.19 are therefore still vulnerable to entity expansions which can lead to a denial of service attack. Users should upgrade to 1.19.1 or later.
CVE-2018-11762	2018-09-19	2018-11-20	5.9	1.52%			In Apache Tika 0.9 to 1.18, in a rare edge case where a user does not specify an extract directory on the commandline (--extract-dir=) and the input file has an embedded file with an absolute path, such as "C:/evil.bat", tika-app would overwrite that file.
CVE-2018-11761	2018-09-19	2019-11-12	7.5	7.99%		Potential	In Apache Tika 0.1 to 1.18, the XML parsers were not configured to limit entity expansion. They were therefore vulnerable to an entity expansion vulnerability which can lead to a denial of service attack.
CVE-2018-8017	2018-09-19	2019-10-03	5.5	2.02%			In Apache Tika 1.2 to 1.18, a carefully crafted file can trigger an infinite loop in the IptcAnpaParser.
CVE-2018-1339	2018-04-25	2019-10-03	5.5	3.00%			A carefully crafted (or fuzzed) file can trigger an infinite loop in Apache Tika's ChmParser in versions of Apache Tika before 1.18.
CVE-2018-1338	2018-04-25	2019-10-03	5.5	3.00%			A carefully crafted (or fuzzed) file can trigger an infinite loop in Apache Tika's BPGParser in versions of Apache Tika before 1.18.
CVE-2018-1335	2018-04-25	2019-10-03	9.3	93.64%		Public	From Apache Tika versions 1.7 to 1.17, clients could send carefully crafted headers to tika-server that could be used to inject commands into the command line of the server running tika-server. This vulnerability only affects those running tika-server on a server that is open to untrusted clients. The mitigation is to upgrade to Tika 1.18.
CVE-2016-6809	2017-04-06	2020-08-19	9.8	9.27%			Apache Tika before 1.14 allows Java code execution for serialized objects embedded in MATLAB files. The issue exists because Tika invokes JMatIO to do native deserialization.
CVE-2016-4434	2017-09-30	2018-10-09	7.8	0.42%			Apache Tika before 1.13 does not properly initialize the XML parser or choose handlers, which might allow remote attackers to conduct XML External Entity (XXE) attacks via vectors involving (1) spreadsheets in OOXML files and (2) XMP metadata in PDF and other file formats, a related issue to CVE-2016-2175.
CVE-2015-3271	2016-12-15	2025-04-12	5.3	0.27%			Apache Tika server (aka tika-server) in Apache Tika 1.9 might allow remote attackers to read arbitrary files via the HTTP fileUrl header.
