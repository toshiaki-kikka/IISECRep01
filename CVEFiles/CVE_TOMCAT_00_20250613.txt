CVE-2025-24813	2025-03-10	2025-04-03	9.8	93.87%	2025-04-01		Path Equivalence: 'file.Name' (Internal Dot) leading to?Remote Code Execution and/or Information disclosure?and/or malicious content added to uploaded files via write enabled?Default Servlet?in Apache Tomcat.\n\nThis issue affects Apache Tomcat: from 11.0.0-M1 through 11.0.2, from 10.1.0-M1 through 10.1.34, from 9.0.0.M1 through 9.0.98.\n\nIf all of the following were true, a malicious user was able to view       security sensitive files and/or inject content into those files:\n-?writes enabled for the default servlet (disabled by default)\n- support for partial PUT (enabled by default)\n- a target URL for security sensitive uploads that was a sub-directory of?a target URL for public uploads\n-?attacker knowledge of the names of security sensitive files being?uploaded\n-?the security sensitive files also being uploaded via partial PUT\n\nIf all of the following were true, a malicious user was able to       perform remote code execution:\n- writes enabled for the default servlet (disabled by default)\n-?support for partial PUT (enabled by default)\n-?application was using Tomcat's file based session persistence with the?default storage location\n-?application included a library that may be leveraged in a?deserialization attack\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 11.0.3, 10.1.35 or 9.0.99, which fixes the issue.
CVE-2024-56337	2024-12-20	2025-01-03	9.8	9.71%			Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition vulnerability in Apache Tomcat.\n\nThis issue affects Apache Tomcat: from 11.0.0-M1 through 11.0.1, from 10.1.0-M1 through 10.1.33, from 9.0.0.M1 through 9.0.97.\n\nThe mitigation for CVE-2024-50379 was incomplete.\n\nUsers running Tomcat on a case insensitive file system with the default servlet write enabled (readonly initialisation \nparameter set to the non-default value of false) may need additional configuration to fully mitigate CVE-2024-50379 depending on which version of Java they are using with Tomcat:\n- running on Java 8 or Java 11: the system property?sun.io.useCanonCaches must be explicitly set to false (it defaults to true)\n- running on Java 17: the?system property sun.io.useCanonCaches, if set, must be set to false?(it defaults to false)\n- running on Java 21 onwards: no further configuration is required?(the system property and the problematic cache have been removed)\n\nTomcat 11.0.3, 10.1.35 and 9.0.99 onwards will include checks that?sun.io.useCanonCaches is set appropriately before allowing the default servlet to be write enabled on a case insensitive file system. Tomcat will also set?sun.io.useCanonCaches to false by default where it can.
CVE-2024-54677	2024-12-17	2025-01-31	5.3	0.98%			Uncontrolled Resource Consumption vulnerability in the examples web application provided with Apache Tomcat leads to denial of service.\n\nThis issue affects Apache Tomcat: from 11.0.0-M1 through 11.0.1, from 10.1.0-M1 through 10.1.33, from 9.0.0.M1 through 9.9.97.\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 11.0.2, 10.1.34 or 9.0.98, which fixes the issue.

If Tomcat is configured to use a custom Jakarta Authentication (formerly JASPIC)?ServerAuthContext component which may throw an exception during the authentication process without explicitly setting an HTTP status to indicate failure, the authentication may not fail, allowing the user to bypass the authentication process. There are no known Jakarta?Authentication components that behave in this way.\n\nThis issue affects Apache Tomcat: from 11.0.0-M1 through 11.0.0-M26, from 10.1.0-M1 through 10.1.30, from 9.0.0-M1 through 9.0.95.\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 11.0.0, 10.1.31 or 9.0.96, which fix the issue.

CVE-2024-34750	2024-07-03	2025-06-03	7.5	19.66%			Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions, Uncontrolled Resource Consumption vulnerability in Apache Tomcat. When processing an HTTP/2 stream, Tomcat did not handle some cases of excessive HTTP headers correctly. This led to a miscounting of active HTTP/2 streams which in turn led to the use of an incorrect infinite timeout which allowed connections to remain open which should have been closed.\n\nThis issue affects Apache Tomcat: from 11.0.0-M1 through 11.0.0-M20, from 10.1.0-M1 through 10.1.24, from 9.0.0-M1 through 9.0.89.\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 11.0.0-M21, 10.1.25 or 9.0.90, which fixes the issue.

CVE-2023-42795	2023-10-10	2025-02-13	5.3	0.51%			Incomplete Cleanup vulnerability in Apache Tomcat.When recycling various internal objects in Apache Tomcat from 11.0.0-M1 through 11.0.0-M11, from 10.1.0-M1 through 10.1.13, from 9.0.0-M1 through 9.0.80 and from 8.5.0 through 8.5.93, an error could \ncause Tomcat to skip some parts of the recycling process leading to \ninformation leaking from the current request/response to the next.\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 11.0.0-M12 onwards, 10.1.14 onwards, 9.0.81 onwards or 8.5.94 onwards, which fixes the issue.
CVE-2023-42794	2023-10-10	2025-02-13	5.9	0.18%			Incomplete Cleanup vulnerability in Apache Tomcat.\n\nThe internal fork of Commons FileUpload packaged with Apache Tomcat 9.0.70 through 9.0.80 and 8.5.85 through 8.5.93 included an unreleased, \nin progress refactoring that exposed a potential denial of service on \nWindows if a web application opened a stream for an uploaded file but \nfailed to close the stream. The file would never be deleted from disk \ncreating the possibility of an eventual denial of service due to the \ndisk being full.\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 9.0.81 onwards or 8.5.94 onwards, which fixes the issue.
CVE-2023-41080	2023-08-25	2023-11-03	6.1	11.12%		Potential	URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect') vulnerability in FORM authentication feature Apache Tomcat.This issue affects Apache Tomcat: from 11.0.0-M1 through 11.0.0-M10, from 10.1.0-M1 through 10.0.12, from 9.0.0-M1 through 9.0.79 and from 8.5.0 through 8.5.92.\n\nThe vulnerability is limited to the ROOT (default) web application.
CVE-2023-34981	2023-06-21	2024-10-09	7.5	0.23%			A regression in the fix for bug 66512 in Apache Tomcat 11.0.0-M5, 10.1.8, 9.0.74 and 8.5.88 meant that, if a response did not include any HTTP headers no AJP SEND_HEADERS messare woudl be sent for the response which in turn meant that at least one AJP proxy (mod_proxy_ajp) would use the response headers from the previous request leading to an information leak.
CVE-2023-28709	2023-05-22	2025-02-13	7.5	0.25%			The fix for CVE-2023-24998 was incomplete for Apache Tomcat 11.0.0-M2 to 11.0.0-M4, 10.1.5 to 10.1.7, 9.0.71 to 9.0.73 and 8.5.85 to 8.5.87. If non-default HTTP       connector settings were used such that the maxParameterCount?could be reached using query string parameters and a request was       submitted that supplied exactly maxParameterCount parameters?in the query string, the limit for uploaded request parts could be?bypassed with the potential for a denial of service to occur.
CVE-2023-28708	2023-03-22	2025-02-13	4.3	0.15%			When using the RemoteIpFilter with requests received from a    reverse proxy via HTTP that include the X-Forwarded-Proto    header set to https, session cookies created by Apache Tomcat 11.0.0-M1 to 11.0.0.-M2, 10.1.0-M1 to 10.1.5, 9.0.0-M1 to 9.0.71 and 8.5.0 to 8.5.85 did not?include the secure attribute. This could result in the user agent?transmitting the session cookie over an insecure channel.
CVE-2022-45143	2023-01-03	2023-06-27	7.5	0.83%			The JsonErrorReportValve in Apache Tomcat 8.5.83, 9.0.40 to 9.0.68 and 10.1.0-M1 to 10.1.1 did not escape the type, message or description values. In some circumstances these are constructed from user provided data and it was therefore possible for users to supply values that invalidated or manipulated the JSON output.
