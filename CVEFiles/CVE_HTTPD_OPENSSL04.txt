CVE	Published	Last Update	Max CVSS Base Score	EPSS Score	CISA KEV Added	Public Exploit Exists	Summary
CVE-2017-3730	2017-05-04	2019-04-25	7.5	60.10%		Potential	In OpenSSL 1.1.0 before 1.1.0d, if a malicious server supplies bad parameters for a DHE or ECDHE key exchange then this can result in the client attempting to dereference a NULL pointer leading to a client crash. This could be exploited in a Denial of Service attack.
CVE-2016-8610	2017-11-13	2024-01-26	7.5	69.24%		Potential	A denial of service flaw was found in OpenSSL 0.9.8, 1.0.1, 1.0.2 through 1.0.2h, and 1.1.0 in the way the TLS/SSL protocol defined processing of ALERT packets during a connection handshake. A remote attacker could use this flaw to make a TLS/SSL server consume an excessive amount of CPU and fail to accept connections from other clients.
CVE-2016-7056	2018-09-10	2023-02-12	5.5	0.41%			A timing attack flaw was found in OpenSSL 1.0.1u and before that could allow a malicious user with local access to recover ECDSA P-256 private keys.
CVE-2016-7055	2017-05-04	2022-09-01	5.9	9.58%			There is a carry propagating bug in the Broadwell-specific Montgomery multiplication procedure in OpenSSL 1.0.2 and 1.1.0 before 1.1.0c that handles input lengths divisible by, but longer than 256 bits. Analysis suggests that attacks against RSA, DSA and DH private keys are impossible. This is because the subroutine in question is not used in operations with the private key itself and an input of the attacker's direct choice. Otherwise the bug can manifest itself as transient authentication and key negotiation failures or reproducible erroneous outcome of public-key operations with specially crafted input. Among EC algorithms only Brainpool P-512 curves are affected and one presumably can attack ECDH key negotiation. Impact was not analyzed in detail, because pre-requisites for attack are considered unlikely. Namely multiple clients have to choose the curve in question and the server has to share the private key among them, neither of which is default behaviour. Even then only clients that chose the curve will be affected.
CVE-2016-7054	2017-05-04	2017-09-03	7.5	25.48%			In OpenSSL 1.1.0 before 1.1.0c, TLS connections using *-CHACHA20-POLY1305 ciphersuites are susceptible to a DoS attack by corrupting larger payloads. This can result in an OpenSSL crash. This issue is not considered to be exploitable beyond a DoS.
CVE-2016-7053	2017-05-04	2017-07-28	7.5	1.06%			In OpenSSL 1.1.0 before 1.1.0c, applications parsing invalid CMS structures can crash with a NULL pointer dereference. This is caused by a bug in the handling of the ASN.1 CHOICE type in OpenSSL 1.1.0 which can result in a NULL value being passed to the structure callback if an attempt is made to free certain invalid encodings. Only CHOICE structures using a callback which do not handle NULL value are affected.
CVE-2016-7052	2016-09-26	2025-04-12	7.5	6.48%			crypto/x509/x509_vfy.c in OpenSSL 1.0.2i allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and application crash) by triggering a CRL operation.
CVE-2016-6309	2016-09-26	2025-04-12	10.0	38.72%			statem/statem.c in OpenSSL 1.1.0a does not consider memory-block movement after a realloc call, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (use-after-free) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted TLS session.
CVE-2016-6308	2016-09-26	2025-04-12	7.1	18.98%			statem/statem_dtls.c in the DTLS implementation in OpenSSL 1.1.0 before 1.1.0a allocates memory before checking for an excessive length, which might allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) via crafted DTLS messages.
CVE-2016-6307	2016-09-26	2025-04-12	5.9	18.82%			The state-machine implementation in OpenSSL 1.1.0 before 1.1.0a allocates memory before checking for an excessive length, which might allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) via crafted TLS messages, related to statem/statem.c and statem/statem_lib.c.

CVE-2016-6302	2016-09-16	2025-04-12	7.5	5.02%			The tls_decrypt_ticket function in ssl/t1_lib.c in OpenSSL before 1.1.0 does not consider the HMAC size during validation of the ticket length, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service via a ticket that is too short.
CVE-2016-2842	2016-03-03	2025-04-12	10.0	65.94%			The doapr_outch function in crypto/bio/b_print.c in OpenSSL 1.0.1 before 1.0.1s and 1.0.2 before 1.0.2g does not verify that a certain memory allocation succeeds, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds write or memory consumption) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a long string, as demonstrated by a large amount of ASN.1 data, a different vulnerability than CVE-2016-0799.
CVE-2016-2183	2016-09-01	2025-04-12	7.5	40.02%			The DES and Triple DES ciphers, as used in the TLS, SSH, and IPSec protocols and other protocols and products, have a birthday bound of approximately four billion blocks, which makes it easier for remote attackers to obtain cleartext data via a birthday attack against a long-duration encrypted session, as demonstrated by an HTTPS session using Triple DES in CBC mode, aka a "Sweet32" attack.
CVE-2016-2182	2016-09-16	2025-04-12	9.8	37.20%			The BN_bn2dec function in crypto/bn/bn_print.c in OpenSSL before 1.1.0 does not properly validate division results, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds write and application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via unknown vectors.
CVE-2016-2181	2016-09-16	2025-04-12	7.5	23.03%			The Anti-Replay feature in the DTLS implementation in OpenSSL before 1.1.0 mishandles early use of a new epoch number in conjunction with a large sequence number, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (false-positive packet drops) via spoofed DTLS records, related to rec_layer_d1.c and ssl3_record.c.

CVE-2016-2179	2016-09-16	2025-04-12	7.5	19.59%			The DTLS implementation in OpenSSL before 1.1.0 does not properly restrict the lifetime of queue entries associated with unused out-of-order messages, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) by maintaining many crafted DTLS sessions simultaneously, related to d1_lib.c, statem_dtls.c, statem_lib.c, and statem_srvr.c.
CVE-2016-2178	2016-06-20	2025-04-12	5.5	0.33%			The dsa_sign_setup function in crypto/dsa/dsa_ossl.c in OpenSSL through 1.0.2h does not properly ensure the use of constant-time operations, which makes it easier for local users to discover a DSA private key via a timing side-channel attack.
CVE-2016-2177	2016-06-20	2025-04-12	9.8	34.31%			OpenSSL through 1.0.2h incorrectly uses pointer arithmetic for heap-buffer boundary checks, which might allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (integer overflow and application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact by leveraging unexpected malloc behavior, related to s3_srvr.c, ssl_sess.c, and t1_lib.c.
CVE-2016-2176	2016-05-05	2025-04-12	8.2	9.40%			The X509_NAME_oneline function in crypto/x509/x509_obj.c in OpenSSL before 1.0.1t and 1.0.2 before 1.0.2h allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information from process stack memory or cause a denial of service (buffer over-read) via crafted EBCDIC ASN.1 data.
