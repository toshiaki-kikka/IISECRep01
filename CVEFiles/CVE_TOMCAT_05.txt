CVE-2014-0033	2014-02-26	2025-04-12	4.3	19.26%			org/apache/catalina/connector/CoyoteAdapter.java in Apache Tomcat 6.0.33 through 6.0.37 does not consider the disableURLRewriting setting when handling a session ID in a URL, which allows remote attackers to conduct session fixation attacks via a crafted URL.
CVE-2013-6357	2013-11-13	2025-04-11	6.8	0.68%		Potential	Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in the Manager application in Apache Tomcat 5.5.25 and earlier allows remote attackers to hijack the authentication of administrators for requests that manipulate application deployment via the POST method, as demonstrated by a /manager/html/undeploy?path= URI.  NOTE: the vendor disputes the significance of this report, stating that "the Apache Tomcat Security team has not accepted any reports of CSRF attacks against the Manager application ... as they require a reckless system administrator.
CVE-2013-4590	2014-02-26	2025-04-11	4.3	0.23%			Apache Tomcat before 6.0.39, 7.x before 7.0.50, and 8.x before 8.0.0-RC10 allows attackers to obtain "Tomcat internals" information by leveraging the presence of an untrusted web application with a context.xml, web.xml, *.jspx, *.tagx, or *.tld XML document containing an external entity declaration in conjunction with an entity reference, related to an XML External Entity (XXE) issue.
CVE-2013-4444	2014-09-12	2025-04-12	6.8	6.21%			Unrestricted file upload vulnerability in Apache Tomcat 7.x before 7.0.40, in certain situations involving outdated java.io.File code and a custom JMX configuration, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by uploading and accessing a JSP file.
CVE-2013-4322	2014-02-26	2025-04-11	4.3	82.55%			Apache Tomcat before 6.0.39, 7.x before 7.0.50, and 8.x before 8.0.0-RC10 processes chunked transfer coding without properly handling (1) a large total amount of chunked data or (2) whitespace characters in an HTTP header value within a trailer field, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service by streaming data.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2012-3544.
CVE-2013-4286	2014-02-26	2025-04-11	5.8	30.96%			Apache Tomcat before 6.0.39, 7.x before 7.0.47, and 8.x before 8.0.0-RC3, when an HTTP connector or AJP connector is used, does not properly handle certain inconsistent HTTP request headers, which allows remote attackers to trigger incorrect identification of a request's length and conduct request-smuggling attacks via (1) multiple Content-Length headers or (2) a Content-Length header and a "Transfer-Encoding: chunked" header.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2005-2090.
CVE-2013-2185	2014-01-19	2025-04-11	7.5	6.59%			The readObject method in the DiskFileItem class in Apache Tomcat and JBoss Web, as used in Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.1.0 and Red Hat JBoss Portal 6.0.0, allows remote attackers to write to arbitrary files via a NULL byte in a file name in a serialized instance, a similar issue to CVE-2013-2186.  NOTE: this issue is reportedly disputed by the Apache Tomcat team, although Red Hat considers it a vulnerability. The dispute appears to regard whether it is the responsibility of applications to avoid providing untrusted data to be deserialized, or whether this class should inherently protect against this issue
CVE-2013-2071	2013-06-01	2025-04-11	2.6	6.87%		Potential	java/org/apache/catalina/core/AsyncContextImpl.java in Apache Tomcat 7.x before 7.0.40 does not properly handle the throwing of a RuntimeException in an AsyncListener in an application, which allows context-dependent attackers to obtain sensitive request information intended for other applications in opportunistic circumstances via an application that records the requests that it processes.
CVE-2013-2067	2013-06-01	2025-04-11	6.8	12.76%			java/org/apache/catalina/authenticator/FormAuthenticator.java in the form authentication feature in Apache Tomcat 6.0.21 through 6.0.36 and 7.x before 7.0.33 does not properly handle the relationships between authentication requirements and sessions, which allows remote attackers to inject a request into a session by sending this request during completion of the login form, a variant of a session fixation attack.
CVE-2013-0346	2014-02-15	2025-04-11	2.1	0.64%			Apache Tomcat 7.x uses world-readable permissions for the log directory and its files, which might allow local users to obtain sensitive information by reading a file. NOTE: One Tomcat distributor has stated "The tomcat log directory does not contain any sensitive information."
CVE-2012-5887	2012-11-17	2025-04-11	5.0	2.29%			The HTTP Digest Access Authentication implementation in Apache Tomcat 5.5.x before 5.5.36, 6.x before 6.0.36, and 7.x before 7.0.30 does not properly check for stale nonce values in conjunction with enforcement of proper credentials, which makes it easier for remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions by sniffing the network for valid requests.
CVE-2012-5886	2012-11-17	2025-04-11	5.0	0.75%			The HTTP Digest Access Authentication implementation in Apache Tomcat 5.5.x before 5.5.36, 6.x before 6.0.36, and 7.x before 7.0.30 caches information about the authenticated user within the session state, which makes it easier for remote attackers to bypass authentication via vectors related to the session ID.
CVE-2012-5885	2012-11-17	2025-04-11	5.0	2.49%			The replay-countermeasure functionality in the HTTP Digest Access Authentication implementation in Apache Tomcat 5.5.x before 5.5.36, 6.x before 6.0.36, and 7.x before 7.0.30 tracks cnonce (aka client nonce) values instead of nonce (aka server nonce) and nc (aka nonce-count) values, which makes it easier for remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions by sniffing the network for valid requests, a different vulnerability than CVE-2011-1184.
CVE-2012-5568	2012-11-30	2025-04-11	5.0	12.62%		Potential	Apache Tomcat through 7.0.x allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (daemon outage) via partial HTTP requests, as demonstrated by Slowloris.
CVE-2012-4534	2012-12-19	2025-04-11	2.6	36.56%		Potential	org/apache/tomcat/util/net/NioEndpoint.java in Apache Tomcat 6.x before 6.0.36 and 7.x before 7.0.28, when the NIO connector is used in conjunction with sendfile and HTTPS, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (infinite loop) by terminating the connection during the reading of a response.
CVE-2012-4431	2012-12-19	2025-04-11	4.3	6.32%			org/apache/catalina/filters/CsrfPreventionFilter.java in Apache Tomcat 6.x before 6.0.36 and 7.x before 7.0.32 allows remote attackers to bypass the cross-site request forgery (CSRF) protection mechanism via a request that lacks a session identifier.
CVE-2012-3546	2012-12-19	2025-04-11	4.3	3.40%			org/apache/catalina/realm/RealmBase.java in Apache Tomcat 6.x before 6.0.36 and 7.x before 7.0.30, when FORM authentication is used, allows remote attackers to bypass security-constraint checks by leveraging a previous setUserPrincipal call and then placing /j_security_check at the end of a URI.
CVE-2012-3544	2013-06-01	2025-04-11	5.0	44.48%			Apache Tomcat 6.x before 6.0.37 and 7.x before 7.0.30 does not properly handle chunk extensions in chunked transfer coding, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service by streaming data.
CVE-2012-2733	2012-11-16	2025-04-11	5.0	12.96%			java/org/apache/coyote/http11/InternalNioInputBuffer.java in the HTTP NIO connector in Apache Tomcat 6.x before 6.0.36 and 7.x before 7.0.28 does not properly restrict the request-header size, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) via a large amount of header data.
CVE-2012-0022	2012-01-19	2025-04-11	5.0	26.52%			Apache Tomcat 5.5.x before 5.5.35, 6.x before 6.0.34, and 7.x before 7.0.23 uses an inefficient approach for handling parameters, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via a request that contains many parameters and parameter values, a different vulnerability than CVE-2011-4858.
CVE-2011-5064	2012-01-14	2025-04-11	4.3	6.55%			DigestAuthenticator.java in the HTTP Digest Access Authentication implementation in Apache Tomcat 5.5.x before 5.5.34, 6.x before 6.0.33, and 7.x before 7.0.12 uses Catalina as the hard-coded server secret (aka private key), which makes it easier for remote attackers to bypass cryptographic protection mechanisms by leveraging knowledge of this string, a different vulnerability than CVE-2011-1184.
