CVE-2013-2461	2013-06-18	2025-04-11	7.5	64.06%			Unspecified vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) component in Oracle Java SE 7 Update 21 and earlier and 6 Update 45 and earlier; the Oracle JRockit component in Oracle Fusion Middleware R27.7.5 and earlier and R28.2.7 and earlier; and OpenJDK 7 allows remote attackers to affect confidentiality, integrity, and availability via unknown vectors related to Libraries.  NOTE: the previous information is from the June and July 2013 CPU. Oracle has not commented on claims from another vendor that this issue allows remote attackers to bypass verification of XML signatures via vectors related to a "Missing check for [a] valid DOMCanonicalizationMethod canonicalization algorithm."
CVE-2013-0169	2013-02-08	2025-04-11	2.6	1.07%			The TLS protocol 1.1 and 1.2 and the DTLS protocol 1.0 and 1.2, as used in OpenSSL, OpenJDK, PolarSSL, and other products, do not properly consider timing side-channel attacks on a MAC check requirement during the processing of malformed CBC padding, which allows remote attackers to conduct distinguishing attacks and plaintext-recovery attacks via statistical analysis of timing data for crafted packets, aka the "Lucky Thirteen" issue.
CVE-2013-0431	2013-01-31	2025-04-11	5.3	92.21%	2022-05-25	Public	Unspecified vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) component in Oracle Java SE 7 through Update 11, and OpenJDK 7, allows user-assisted remote attackers to bypass the Java security sandbox via unspecified vectors related to JMX, aka "Issue 52," a different vulnerability than CVE-2013-1490.
CVE-2012-5373	2012-11-28	2025-04-11	5.0	0.51%			Oracle Java SE 7 and earlier, and OpenJDK 7 and earlier, computes hash values without properly restricting the ability to trigger hash collisions predictably, which allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via crafted input to an application that maintains a hash table, as demonstrated by a universal multicollision attack against the MurmurHash3 algorithm, a different vulnerability than CVE-2012-2739.
CVE-2012-2739	2012-11-28	2025-04-11	5.0	1.05%		Potential	Oracle Java SE before 7 Update 6, and OpenJDK 7 before 7u6 build 12 and 8 before build 39, computes hash values without restricting the ability to trigger hash collisions predictably, which allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via crafted input to an application that maintains a hash table.
CVE-2009-0581	2009-03-23	2025-04-09	4.3	2.12%		Potential	Memory leak in LittleCMS (aka lcms or liblcms) before 1.18beta2, as used in Firefox 3.1beta, OpenJDK, and GIMP, allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption and application crash) via a crafted image file.
