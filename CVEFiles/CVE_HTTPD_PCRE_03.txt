CVE	Published	Last Update	Max CVSS Base Score	EPSS Score	CISA KEV Added	Public Exploit Exists	Summary
CVE-2007-1659	2007-11-07	2025-04-09	6.8	5.34%			Perl-Compatible Regular Expression (PCRE) library before 7.3 allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via regex patterns containing unmatched "\Q\E" sequences with orphan "\E" codes.
CVE-2006-7230	2007-11-15	2025-04-09	4.3	2.48%			Perl-Compatible Regular Expression (PCRE) library before 7.0 does not properly calculate the amount of memory needed for a compiled regular expression pattern when the (1) -x or (2) -i UTF-8 options change within the pattern, which allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (PCRE or glibc crash) via crafted regular expressions.
CVE-2006-7228	2007-11-14	2025-04-09	6.8	2.88%			Integer overflow in Perl-Compatible Regular Expression (PCRE) library before 6.7 might allow context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary code via a regular expression that involves large (1) min, (2) max, or (3) duplength values that cause an incorrect length calculation and trigger a buffer overflow, a different vulnerability than CVE-2006-7227.  NOTE: this issue was originally subsumed by CVE-2006-7224, but that CVE has been REJECTED and split.
CVE-2006-7227	2007-11-14	2025-04-09	6.8	2.17%			Integer overflow in Perl-Compatible Regular Expression (PCRE) library before 6.7 allows context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary code via a regular expression containing a large number of named subpatterns (name_count) or long subpattern names (max_name_size), which triggers a buffer overflow.  NOTE: this issue was originally subsumed by CVE-2006-7224, but that CVE has been REJECTED and split.
CVE-2005-4872	2005-12-31	2025-04-03	4.3	1.50%			Perl-Compatible Regular Expression (PCRE) library before 6.2 does not properly count the number of named capturing subpatterns, which allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via a regular expression with a large number of named subpatterns, which triggers a buffer overflow.  NOTE: this issue was originally subsumed by CVE-2006-7224, but that CVE has been REJECTED and split.
CVE-2005-2491	2005-08-23	2025-04-03	7.5	1.91%			Integer overflow in pcre_compile.c in Perl Compatible Regular Expressions (PCRE) before 6.2, as used in multiple products such as Python, Ethereal, and PHP, allows attackers to execute arbitrary code via quantifier values in regular expressions, which leads to a heap-based buffer overflow.
