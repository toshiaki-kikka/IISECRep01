CVE	Published	Last Update	Max CVSS Base Score	EPSS Score	CISA KEV Added	Public Exploit Exists	Summary
CVE-2019-14439	2019-07-30	2023-09-13	7.5	10.32%		Potential	A Polymorphic Typing issue was discovered in FasterXML jackson-databind 2.x before 2.9.9.2. This occurs when Default Typing is enabled (either globally or for a specific property) for an externally exposed JSON endpoint and the service has the logback jar in the classpath.
CVE-2019-14379	2019-07-29	2023-09-13	9.8	1.42%			SubTypeValidator.java in FasterXML jackson-databind before 2.9.9.2 mishandles default typing when ehcache is used (because of net.sf.ehcache.transaction.manager.DefaultTransactionManagerLookup), leading to remote code execution.
CVE-2019-12814	2019-06-19	2023-09-13	5.9	22.91%		Potential	A Polymorphic Typing issue was discovered in FasterXML jackson-databind 2.x through 2.9.9. When Default Typing is enabled (either globally or for a specific property) for an externally exposed JSON endpoint and the service has JDOM 1.x or 2.x jar in the classpath, an attacker can send a specifically crafted JSON message that allows them to read arbitrary local files on the server.
CVE-2019-12384	2019-06-24	2023-09-13	5.9	45.31%		Potential	FasterXML jackson-databind 2.x before 2.9.9.1 might allow attackers to have a variety of impacts by leveraging failure to block the logback-core class from polymorphic deserialization. Depending on the classpath content, remote code execution may be possible.
CVE-2019-12086	2019-05-17	2023-09-13	7.5	15.75%		Potential	A Polymorphic Typing issue was discovered in FasterXML jackson-databind 2.x before 2.9.9. When Default Typing is enabled (either globally or for a specific property) for an externally exposed JSON endpoint, the service has the mysql-connector-java jar (8.0.14 or earlier) in the classpath, and an attacker can host a crafted MySQL server reachable by the victim, an attacker can send a crafted JSON message that allows them to read arbitrary local files on the server. This occurs because of missing com.mysql.cj.jdbc.admin.MiniAdmin validation.
CVE-2018-19362	2019-01-02	2020-08-31	9.8	7.60%			FasterXML jackson-databind 2.x before 2.9.8 might allow attackers to have unspecified impact by leveraging failure to block the jboss-common-core class from polymorphic deserialization.

CVE-2018-19360	2019-01-02	2020-08-31	9.8	7.60%			FasterXML jackson-databind 2.x before 2.9.8 might allow attackers to have unspecified impact by leveraging failure to block the axis2-transport-jms class from polymorphic deserialization.
CVE-2018-14721	2019-01-02	2020-08-31	10.0	4.55%			FasterXML jackson-databind 2.x before 2.9.7 might allow remote attackers to conduct server-side request forgery (SSRF) attacks by leveraging failure to block the axis2-jaxws class from polymorphic deserialization.
CVE-2018-14720	2019-01-02	2020-08-31	9.8	2.83%			FasterXML jackson-databind 2.x before 2.9.7 might allow attackers to conduct external XML entity (XXE) attacks by leveraging failure to block unspecified JDK classes from polymorphic deserialization.
CVE-2018-14719	2019-01-02	2023-09-13	9.8	2.89%			FasterXML jackson-databind 2.x before 2.9.7 might allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by leveraging failure to block the blaze-ds-opt and blaze-ds-core classes from polymorphic deserialization.
CVE-2018-14718	2019-01-02	2023-09-13	9.8	13.04%			FasterXML jackson-databind 2.x before 2.9.7 might allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by leveraging failure to block the slf4j-ext class from polymorphic deserialization.
CVE-2018-12023	2019-03-21	2020-10-20	7.5	4.90%			An issue was discovered in FasterXML jackson-databind prior to 2.7.9.4, 2.8.11.2, and 2.9.6. When Default Typing is enabled (either globally or for a specific property), the service has the Oracle JDBC jar in the classpath, and an attacker can provide an LDAP service to access, it is possible to make the service execute a malicious payload.
CVE-2018-12022	2019-03-21	2023-09-13	7.5	3.09%			An issue was discovered in FasterXML jackson-databind prior to 2.7.9.4, 2.8.11.2, and 2.9.6. When Default Typing is enabled (either globally or for a specific property), the service has the Jodd-db jar (for database access for the Jodd framework) in the classpath, and an attacker can provide an LDAP service to access, it is possible to make the service execute a malicious payload.
CVE-2018-11307	2019-07-09	2024-04-03	9.8	12.64%			An issue was discovered in FasterXML jackson-databind 2.0.0 through 2.9.5. Use of Jackson default typing along with a gadget class from iBatis allows exfiltration of content. Fixed in 2.7.9.4, 2.8.11.2, and 2.9.6.
CVE-2018-7489	2018-02-26	2021-03-25	9.8	27.83%			FasterXML jackson-databind before 2.7.9.3, 2.8.x before 2.8.11.1 and 2.9.x before 2.9.5 allows unauthenticated remote code execution because of an incomplete fix for the CVE-2017-7525 deserialization flaw. This is exploitable by sending maliciously crafted JSON input to the readValue method of the ObjectMapper, bypassing a blacklist that is ineffective if the c3p0 libraries are available in the classpath.
CVE-2018-5968	2018-01-22	2023-09-13	8.1	2.58%			FasterXML jackson-databind through 2.8.11 and 2.9.x through 2.9.3 allows unauthenticated remote code execution because of an incomplete fix for the CVE-2017-7525 and CVE-2017-17485 deserialization flaws. This is exploitable via two different gadgets that bypass a blacklist.
CVE-2017-17485	2018-01-10	2023-06-08	9.8	73.66%		Potential	FasterXML jackson-databind through 2.8.10 and 2.9.x through 2.9.3 allows unauthenticated remote code execution because of an incomplete fix for the CVE-2017-7525 deserialization flaw. This is exploitable by sending maliciously crafted JSON input to the readValue method of the ObjectMapper, bypassing a blacklist that is ineffective if the Spring libraries are available in the classpath.
CVE-2017-15095	2018-02-06	2023-09-13	9.8	8.57%			A deserialization flaw was discovered in the jackson-databind in versions before 2.8.10 and 2.9.1, which could allow an unauthenticated user to perform code execution by sending the maliciously crafted input to the readValue method of the ObjectMapper. This issue extends the previous flaw CVE-2017-7525 by blacklisting more classes that could be used maliciously.
CVE-2017-7525	2018-02-06	2023-06-08	9.8	77.42%		Potential	A deserialization flaw was discovered in the jackson-databind, versions before 2.6.7.1, 2.7.9.1 and 2.8.9, which could allow an unauthenticated user to perform code execution by sending the maliciously crafted input to the readValue method of the ObjectMapper.
