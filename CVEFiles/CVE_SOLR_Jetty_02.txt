CVE-2019-17632	2019-11-25	2021-06-14	6.1	1.42%			In Eclipse Jetty versions 9.4.21.v20190926, 9.4.22.v20191022, and 9.4.23.v20191118, the generation of default unhandled Error response content (in text/html and text/json Content-Type) does not escape Exception messages in stacktraces included in error output.
CVE-2019-10247	2019-04-22	2022-04-22	5.3	2.11%			In Eclipse Jetty version 7.x, 8.x, 9.2.27 and older, 9.3.26 and older, and 9.4.16 and older, the server running on any OS and Jetty version combination will reveal the configured fully qualified directory base resource location on the output of the 404 error for not finding a Context that matches the requested path. The default server behavior on jetty-distribution and jetty-home will include at the end of the Handler tree a DefaultHandler, which is responsible for reporting this 404 error, it presents the various configured contexts as HTML for users to click through to. This produced HTML includes output that contains the configured fully qualified directory base resource location for each context.
CVE-2019-10246	2019-04-22	2021-06-14	5.3	1.70%			In Eclipse Jetty version 9.2.27, 9.3.26, and 9.4.16, the server running on Windows is vulnerable to exposure of the fully qualified Base Resource directory name on Windows to a remote client when it is configured for showing a Listing of directory contents. This information reveal is restricted to only the content in the configured base resource directories.
CVE-2019-10241	2019-04-22	2022-04-22	6.1	26.94%			In Eclipse Jetty version 9.2.26 and older, 9.3.25 and older, and 9.4.15 and older, the server is vulnerable to XSS conditions if a remote client USES a specially formatted URL against the DefaultServlet or ResourceHandler that is configured for showing a Listing of directory contents.
CVE-2018-12545	2019-03-27	2020-10-23	7.5	4.18%			In Eclipse Jetty version 9.3.x and 9.4.x, the server is vulnerable to Denial of Service conditions if a remote client sends either large SETTINGs frames container containing many settings, or many small SETTINGs frames. The vulnerability is due to the additional CPU and memory allocations required to handle changed settings.
CVE-2018-12538	2018-06-22	2020-10-20	8.8	0.78%			In Eclipse Jetty versions 9.4.0 through 9.4.8, when using the optional Jetty provided FileSessionDataStore for persistent storage of HttpSession details, it is possible for a malicious user to access/hijack other HttpSessions and even delete unmatched HttpSessions present in the FileSystem's storage for the FileSessionDataStore.
CVE-2018-12536	2018-06-27	2021-05-14	5.3	1.05%			In Eclipse Jetty Server, all 9.x versions, on webapps deployed using default Error Handling, when an intentionally bad query arrives that doesn't match a dynamic url-pattern, and is eventually handled by the DefaultServlet's static file serving, the bad characters can trigger a java.nio.file.InvalidPathException which includes the full path to the base resource directory that the DefaultServlet and/or webapp is using. If this InvalidPathException is then handled by the default Error Handler, the InvalidPathException message is included in the error response, revealing the full server path to the requesting system.
CVE-2017-9735	2017-06-16	2022-03-15	7.5	0.64%			Jetty through 9.4.x is prone to a timing channel in util/security/Password.java, which makes it easier for remote attackers to obtain access by observing elapsed times before rejection of incorrect passwords.
CVE-2017-7658	2018-06-26	2021-07-20	9.8	6.14%			In Eclipse Jetty Server, versions 9.2.x and older, 9.3.x (all non HTTP/1.x configurations), and 9.4.x (all HTTP/1.x configurations), when presented with two content-lengths headers, Jetty ignored the second. When presented with a content-length and a chunked encoding header, the content-length was ignored (as per RFC 2616). If an intermediary decided on the shorter length, but still passed on the longer body, then body content could be interpreted by Jetty as a pipelined request. If the intermediary was imposing authorization, the fake pipelined request would bypass that authorization.
CVE-2017-7657	2018-06-26	2021-07-20	9.8	2.11%			In Eclipse Jetty, versions 9.2.x and older, 9.3.x (all configurations), and 9.4.x (non-default configuration with RFC2616 compliance enabled), transfer-encoding chunks are handled poorly. The chunk length parsing was vulnerable to an integer overflow. Thus a large chunk size could be interpreted as a smaller chunk size and content sent as chunk body could be interpreted as a pipelined request. If Jetty was deployed behind an intermediary that imposed some authorization and that intermediary allowed arbitrarily large chunks to be passed on unchanged, then this flaw could be used to bypass the authorization imposed by the intermediary as the fake pipelined request would not be interpreted by the intermediary as a request.
CVE-2017-7656	2018-06-26	2021-07-20	7.5	2.79%			In Eclipse Jetty, versions 9.2.x and older, 9.3.x (all configurations), and 9.4.x (non-default configuration with RFC2616 compliance enabled), HTTP/0.9 is handled poorly. An HTTP/1 style request line (i.e. method space URI space version) that declares a version of HTTP/0.9 was accepted and treated as a 0.9 request. If deployed behind an intermediary that also accepted and passed through the 0.9 version (but did not act on it), then the response sent could be interpreted by the intermediary as HTTP/1 headers. This could be used to poison the cache if the server allowed the origin client to generate arbitrary content in the response.
CVE-2016-4800	2017-04-13	2020-10-20	9.8	0.47%			The path normalization mechanism in PathResource class in Eclipse Jetty 9.3.x before 9.3.9 on Windows allows remote attackers to bypass protected resource restrictions and other security constraints via a URL with certain escaped characters, related to backslashes.
CVE-2015-2080	2016-10-07	2025-04-12	7.5	91.47%		Potential	The exception handling code in Eclipse Jetty before 9.2.9.v20150224 allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information from process memory via illegal characters in an HTTP header, aka JetLeak.
CVE-2009-5046	2019-11-06	2019-11-13	6.1	1.24%			JSP Dump and Session Dump Servlet XSS in jetty before 6.1.22.
CVE-2009-5045	2019-11-06	2019-11-13	7.5	2.44%			Dump Servlet information leak in jetty before 6.1.22.
