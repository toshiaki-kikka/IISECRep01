CVE	Published	Last Update	Max CVSS Base Score	EPSS Score	CISA KEV Added	Public Exploit Exists	Summary
CVE-2022-28615	2022-06-09	2022-08-24	9.1	0.54%			Apache HTTP Server 2.4.53 and earlier may crash or disclose information due to a read beyond bounds in ap_strcmp_match() when provided with an extremely large input buffer. While no code distributed with the server can be coerced into such a call, third-party modules or lua scripts that use ap_strcmp_match() may hypothetically be affected.
CVE-2022-28614	2022-06-09	2022-08-24	5.3	0.18%			The ap_rwrite() function in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.53 and earlier may read unintended memory if an attacker can cause the server to reflect very large input using ap_rwrite() or ap_rputs(), such as with mod_luas r:puts() function. Modules compiled and distributed separately from Apache HTTP Server that use the 'ap_rputs' function and may pass it a very large (INT_MAX or larger) string must be compiled against current headers to resolve the issue.
CVE-2022-28330	2022-06-09	2022-06-24	5.3	0.19%			Apache HTTP Server 2.4.53 and earlier on Windows may read beyond bounds when configured to process requests with the mod_isapi module.
CVE-2022-26377	2022-06-09	2022-08-24	7.5	48.41%		Potential	Inconsistent Interpretation of HTTP Requests ('HTTP Request Smuggling') vulnerability in mod_proxy_ajp of Apache HTTP Server allows an attacker to smuggle requests to the AJP server it forwards requests to. This issue affects Apache HTTP Server Apache HTTP Server 2.4 version 2.4.53 and prior versions.
CVE-2022-23943	2022-03-14	2022-10-26	9.8	68.53%			Out-of-bounds Write vulnerability in mod_sed of Apache HTTP Server allows an attacker to overwrite heap memory with possibly attacker provided data. This issue affects Apache HTTP Server 2.4 version 2.4.52 and prior versions.
CVE-2022-22721	2022-03-14	2022-11-02	9.1	31.73%			If LimitXMLRequestBody is set to allow request bodies larger than 350MB (defaults to 1M) on 32 bit systems an integer overflow happens which later causes out of bounds writes. This issue affects Apache HTTP Server 2.4.52 and earlier.
CVE-2022-22720	2022-03-14	2022-11-02	9.8	37.18%			Apache HTTP Server 2.4.52 and earlier fails to close inbound connection when errors are encountered discarding the request body, exposing the server to HTTP Request Smuggling
CVE-2022-22719	2022-03-14	2022-11-02	7.5	47.15%			A carefully crafted request body can cause a read to a random memory area which could cause the process to crash. This issue affects Apache HTTP Server 2.4.52 and earlier.
CVE-2021-44790	2021-12-20	2023-04-03	9.8	79.12%		Potential	A carefully crafted request body can cause a buffer overflow in the mod_lua multipart parser (r:parsebody() called from Lua scripts). The Apache httpd team is not aware of an exploit for the vulnerabilty though it might be possible to craft one. This issue affects Apache HTTP Server 2.4.51 and earlier.
CVE-2021-44224	2021-12-20	2022-11-02	8.2	11.04%			A crafted URI sent to httpd configured as a forward proxy (ProxyRequests on) can cause a crash (NULL pointer dereference) or, for configurations mixing forward and reverse proxy declarations, can allow for requests to be directed to a declared Unix Domain Socket endpoint (Server Side Request Forgery). This issue affects Apache HTTP Server 2.4.7 up to 2.4.51 (included).
CVE-2021-42013	2021-10-07	2025-03-21	9.8	94.43%	2021-11-03	Public	It was found that the fix for CVE-2021-41773 in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.50 was insufficient. An attacker could use a path traversal attack to map URLs to files outside the directories configured by Alias-like directives. If files outside of these directories are not protected by the usual default configuration "require all denied", these requests can succeed. If CGI scripts are also enabled for these aliased pathes, this could allow for remote code execution. This issue only affects Apache 2.4.49 and Apache 2.4.50 and not earlier versions.
CVE-2021-41773	2021-10-05	2025-03-21	7.5	94.40%	2021-11-03	Public	A flaw was found in a change made to path normalization in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.49. An attacker could use a path traversal attack to map URLs to files outside the directories configured by Alias-like directives. If files outside of these directories are not protected by the usual default configuration "require all denied", these requests can succeed. If CGI scripts are also enabled for these aliased pathes, this could allow for remote code execution. This issue is known to be exploited in the wild. This issue only affects Apache 2.4.49 and not earlier versions. The fix in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.50 was found to be incomplete, see CVE-2021-42013.
CVE-2021-41524	2021-10-05	2022-10-28	7.5	6.59%			While fuzzing the 2.4.49 httpd, a new null pointer dereference was detected during HTTP/2 request processing, allowing an external source to DoS the server. This requires a specially crafted request. The vulnerability was recently introduced in version 2.4.49. No exploit is known to the project.
CVE-2021-40438	2021-09-16	2025-03-21	9.0	94.43%	2021-12-01	Public	A crafted request uri-path can cause mod_proxy to forward the request to an origin server choosen by the remote user. This issue affects Apache HTTP Server 2.4.48 and earlier.
CVE-2021-39275	2021-09-16	2022-10-05	9.8	40.03%			ap_escape_quotes() may write beyond the end of a buffer when given malicious input. No included modules pass untrusted data to these functions, but third-party / external modules may. This issue affects Apache HTTP Server 2.4.48 and earlier.
CVE-2021-36160	2021-09-16	2022-10-18	7.5	3.88%			A carefully crafted request uri-path can cause mod_proxy_uwsgi to read above the allocated memory and crash (DoS). This issue affects Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.30 to 2.4.48 (inclusive).
CVE-2021-34798	2021-09-16	2022-10-28	7.5	8.58%			Malformed requests may cause the server to dereference a NULL pointer. This issue affects Apache HTTP Server 2.4.48 and earlier.
CVE-2021-33193	2021-08-16	2023-03-03	7.5	0.63%		Potential	A crafted method sent through HTTP/2 will bypass validation and be forwarded by mod_proxy, which can lead to request splitting or cache poisoning. This issue affects Apache HTTP Server 2.4.17 to 2.4.48.
CVE-2021-31618	2021-06-15	2024-05-01	7.5	18.52%			Apache HTTP Server protocol handler for the HTTP/2 protocol checks received request headers against the size limitations as configured for the server and used for the HTTP/1 protocol as well. On violation of these restrictions and HTTP response is sent to the client with a status code indicating why the request was rejected. This rejection response was not fully initialised in the HTTP/2 protocol handler if the offending header was the very first one received or appeared in a a footer. This led to a NULL pointer dereference on initialised memory, crashing reliably the child process. Since such a triggering HTTP/2 request is easy to craft and submit, this can be exploited to DoS the server. This issue affected mod_http2 1.15.17 and Apache HTTP Server version 2.4.47 only. Apache HTTP Server 2.4.47 was never released.
CVE-2021-30641	2021-06-10	2021-12-02	5.3	24.56%			Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.39 to 2.4.46 Unexpected matching behavior with 'MergeSlashes OFF'
CVE-2021-26691	2021-06-10	2022-03-25	9.8	49.12%			In Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.0 to 2.4.46 a specially crafted SessionHeader sent by an origin server could cause a heap overflow
CVE-2021-26690	2021-06-10	2021-12-01	7.5	58.68%			Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.0 to 2.4.46 A specially crafted Cookie header handled by mod_session can cause a NULL pointer dereference and crash, leading to a possible Denial Of Service
CVE-2020-35452	2021-06-10	2021-12-01	7.3	6.56%			Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.0 to 2.4.46 A specially crafted Digest nonce can cause a stack overflow in mod_auth_digest. There is no report of this overflow being exploitable, nor the Apache HTTP Server team could create one, though some particular compiler and/or compilation option might make it possible, with limited consequences anyway due to the size (a single byte) and the value (zero byte) of the overflow
CVE-2020-13950	2021-06-10	2021-12-01	7.5	17.00%			Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.41 to 2.4.46 mod_proxy_http can be made to crash (NULL pointer dereference) with specially crafted requests using both Content-Length and Transfer-Encoding headers, leading to a Denial of Service
CVE-2020-13938	2021-06-10	2022-04-15	5.5	0.49%			Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.0 to 2.4.46 Unprivileged local users can stop httpd on Windows
