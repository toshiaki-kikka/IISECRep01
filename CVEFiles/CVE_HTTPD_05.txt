NOTE: the vendor states "this is not a security issue in httpd as such."
CVE-2013-4352	2014-07-20	2025-04-12	4.3	18.66%			The cache_invalidate function in modules/cache/cache_storage.c in the mod_cache module in the Apache HTTP Server 2.4.6, when a caching forward proxy is enabled, allows remote HTTP servers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and daemon crash) via vectors that trigger a missing hostname value.
CVE-2013-2249	2013-07-23	2025-04-11	7.5	33.66%		Potential	mod_session_dbd.c in the mod_session_dbd module in the Apache HTTP Server before 2.4.5 proceeds with save operations for a session without considering the dirty flag and the requirement for a new session ID, which has unspecified impact and remote attack vectors.

CVE-2013-1862	2013-06-10	2025-04-11	5.1	21.46%			mod_rewrite.c in the mod_rewrite module in the Apache HTTP Server 2.2.x before 2.2.25 writes data to a log file without sanitizing non-printable characters, which might allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands via an HTTP request containing an escape sequence for a terminal emulator.
CVE-2012-4558	2013-02-26	2025-04-11	4.3	58.49%			Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in the balancer_handler function in the manager interface in mod_proxy_balancer.c in the mod_proxy_balancer module in the Apache HTTP Server 2.2.x before 2.2.24-dev and 2.4.x before 2.4.4 allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via a crafted string.

CVE-2012-3502	2012-08-22	2025-04-11	4.3	4.44%			The proxy functionality in (1) mod_proxy_ajp.c in the mod_proxy_ajp module and (2) mod_proxy_http.c in the mod_proxy_http module in the Apache HTTP Server 2.4.x before 2.4.3 does not properly determine the situations that require closing a back-end connection, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information in opportunistic circumstances by reading a response that was intended for a different client.
CVE-2012-3499	2013-02-26	2025-04-11	4.3	21.79%			Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in the Apache HTTP Server 2.2.x before 2.2.24-dev and 2.4.x before 2.4.4 allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via vectors involving hostnames and URIs in the (1) mod_imagemap, (2) mod_info, (3) mod_ldap, (4) mod_proxy_ftp, and (5) mod_status modules.
