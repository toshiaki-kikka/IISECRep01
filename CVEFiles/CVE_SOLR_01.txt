CVE-2025-24814	2025-01-27	2025-02-15	5.4	0.07%			Core creation allows users to replace "trusted" configset files with arbitrary configuration\n\nSolr instances that (1) use the "FileSystemConfigSetService" component (the default in "standalone" or "user-managed" mode), and (2) are running without authentication and authorization are vulnerable to a sort of privilege escalation wherein individual "trusted" configset files can be ignored in favor of potentially-untrusted replacements available elsewhere on the filesystem.? These replacement config files are treated as "trusted" and can use "<lib>" tags to add to Solr's classpath, which an attacker might use to load malicious code as a searchComponent or other plugin.\n\nThis issue affects all Apache Solr versions up through Solr 9.7.? Users can protect against the vulnerability by enabling authentication and authorization on their Solr clusters or switching to SolrCloud (and away from "FileSystemConfigSetService").? Users are also recommended to upgrade to Solr 9.8.0, which mitigates this issue by disabling use of "<lib>" tags by default.
CVE-2024-52012	2025-01-27	2025-02-06	5.4	0.16%			Relative Path Traversal vulnerability in Apache Solr.\n\nSolr instances running on Windows are vulnerable to arbitrary filepath write-access, due to a lack of input-sanitation in the "configset upload" API.? Commonly known as a "zipslip", maliciously constructed ZIP files can use relative filepaths to write data to unanticipated parts of the filesystem.??\nThis issue affects Apache Solr: from 6.6 through 9.7.0.\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 9.8.0, which fixes the issue.? Users unable to upgrade may also safely prevent the issue by using Solr's "Rule-Based Authentication Plugin" to restrict access to the configset upload API, so that it can only be accessed by a trusted set of administrators/users.
CVE-2024-45217	2024-10-16	2024-10-16	8.1	0.21%			Insecure Default Initialization of Resource vulnerability in Apache Solr.\n\nNew ConfigSets that are created via a Restore command, which copy a configSet from the backup and give it a new name, are created without setting the "trusted" metadata.\nConfigSets that do not contain the flag are trusted implicitly if the metadata is missing, therefore this leads to "trusted" ConfigSets that may not have been created with an Authenticated request.\n"trusted" ConfigSets are able to load custom code into classloaders, therefore the flag is supposed to only be set when the request that uploads the ConfigSet is Authenticated & Authorized.\n\nThis issue affects Apache Solr: from 6.6.0 before 8.11.4, from 9.0.0 before 9.7.0. This issue does not affect Solr instances that are secured via Authentication/Authorization.\n\nUsers are primarily recommended to use Authentication and Authorization when running Solr. However, upgrading to version 9.7.0, or 8.11.4 will mitigate this issue otherwise.
CVE-2024-45216	2024-10-16	2024-10-16	9.8	93.90%			Improper Authentication vulnerability in Apache Solr.\n\nSolr instances using the PKIAuthenticationPlugin, which is enabled by default when Solr Authentication is used, are vulnerable to Authentication bypass.\nA fake ending at the end of any Solr API URL path, will allow requests to skip Authentication while maintaining the API contract with the original URL Path.\nThis fake ending looks like an unprotected API path, however it is stripped off internally after authentication but before API routing.\n\n\nThis issue affects Apache Solr: from 5.3.0 before 8.11.4, from 9.0.0 before 9.7.0.\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 9.7.0, or 8.11.4, which fix the issue.
CVE-2023-50386	2024-02-09	2025-04-24	8.8	82.66%		Public	Improper Control of Dynamically-Managed Code Resources, Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type, Inclusion of Functionality from Untrusted Control Sphere vulnerability in Apache Solr.This issue affects Apache Solr: from 6.0.0 through 8.11.2, from 9.0.0 before 9.4.1.\n\nIn the affected versions, Solr ConfigSets accepted Java jar and class files to be uploaded through the ConfigSets API.\nWhen backing up Solr Collections, these configSet files would be saved to disk when using the LocalFileSystemRepository (the default for backups).\nIf the backup was saved to a directory that Solr uses in its ClassPath/ClassLoaders, then the jar and class files would be available to use with any ConfigSet, trusted or untrusted.\n\nWhen Solr is run in a secure way (Authorization enabled), as is strongly suggested, this vulnerability is limited to extending the Backup permissions with the ability to add libraries.\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 8.11.3 or 9.4.1, which fix the issue.\nIn these versions, the following protections have been added:\n\n  *  Users are no longer able to upload files to a configSet that could be executed via a Java ClassLoader.\n  *  The Backup API restricts saving backups to directories that are used in the ClassLoader.
CVE-2023-50298	2024-02-09	2025-02-13	7.5	0.03%			Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor vulnerability in Apache Solr.This issue affects Apache Solr: from 6.0.0 through 8.11.2, from 9.0.0 before 9.4.1.\n\nSolr Streaming Expressions allows users to extract data from other Solr Clouds, using a "zkHost" parameter.\nWhen original SolrCloud is setup to use ZooKeeper credentials and ACLs, they will be sent to whatever "zkHost" the user provides.\nAn attacker could setup a server to mock ZooKeeper, that accepts ZooKeeper requests with credentials and ACLs and extracts the sensitive information,\nthen send a streaming expression using the mock server's address in "zkHost".\nStreaming Expressions are exposed via the "/streaming" handler, with "read" permissions.\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 8.11.3 or 9.4.1, which fix the issue.\nFrom these versions on, only zkHost values that have the same server address (regardless of chroot), will use the given ZooKeeper credentials and ACLs when connecting.
CVE-2023-50292	2024-02-09	2025-02-13	7.5	34.35%			Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource, Improper Control of Dynamically-Managed Code Resources vulnerability in Apache Solr.\n\nThis issue affects Apache Solr: from 8.10.0 through 8.11.2, from 9.0.0 before 9.3.0.\n\nThe Schema Designer was introduced to allow users to more easily configure and test new Schemas and configSets.\nHowever, when the feature was created, the "trust" (authentication) of these configSets was not considered.\nExternal library loading is only available to configSets that are "trusted" (created by authenticated users), thus non-authenticated users are unable to perform Remote Code Execution.\nSince the Schema Designer loaded configSets without taking their "trust" into account, configSets that were created by unauthenticated users were allowed to load external libraries when used in the Schema Designer.\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 9.3.0, which fixes the issue.
CVE-2023-50291	2024-02-09	2025-02-13	7.5	0.28%			Insufficiently Protected Credentials vulnerability in Apache Solr.\n\nThis issue affects Apache Solr: from 6.0.0 through 8.11.2, from 9.0.0 before 9.3.0.\nOne of the two endpoints that publishes the Solr process' Java system properties, /admin/info/properties, was only setup to hide system properties that had "password" contained in the name.\nThere are a number of sensitive system properties, such as "basicauth" and "aws.secretKey" do not contain "password", thus their values were published via the "/admin/info/properties" endpoint.\nThis endpoint populates the list of System Properties on the home screen of the Solr Admin page, making the exposed credentials visible in the UI.\n\nThis /admin/info/properties endpoint is protected under the "config-read" permission.\nTherefore, Solr Clouds with Authorization enabled will only be vulnerable through logged-in users that have the "config-read" permission.\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 9.3.0 or 8.11.3, which fixes the issue.\nA single option now controls hiding Java system property for all endpoints, "-Dsolr.hiddenSysProps".\nBy default all known sensitive properties are hidden (including "-Dbasicauth"), as well as any property with a name containing "secret" or "password".\n\nUsers who cannot upgrade can also use the following Java system property to fix the issue:\n? '-Dsolr.redaction.system.pattern=.*(password|secret|basicauth).*'
CVE-2023-50290	2024-01-15	2024-01-22	6.5	93.00%			Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor vulnerability in Apache Solr.\nThe Solr Metrics API publishes all unprotected environment variables available to each Apache Solr instance. Users are able to specify which environment variables to hide, however, the default list is designed to work for known secret Java system properties. Environment variables cannot be strictly defined in Solr, like Java system properties can be, and may be set for the entire host,?unlike Java system properties which are set per-Java-proccess.\n\nThe Solr Metrics API is protected by the "metrics-read" permission.\nTherefore, Solr Clouds with Authorization setup will only be vulnerable via users with the "metrics-read" permission.\nThis issue affects Apache Solr: from 9.0.0 before 9.3.0.\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 9.3.0 or later, in which environment variables are not published via the Metrics API.
CVE-2023-44487	2023-10-10	2025-04-12	7.5	94.41%	2023-10-10	Potential	The HTTP/2 protocol allows a denial of service (server resource consumption) because request cancellation can reset many streams quickly, as exploited in the wild in August through October 2023.
CVE-2021-44548	2021-12-23	2022-08-09	9.8	1.13%			An Improper Input Validation vulnerability in DataImportHandler of Apache Solr allows an attacker to provide a Windows UNC path resulting in an SMB network call being made from the Solr host to another host on the network. If the attacker has wider access to the network, this may lead to SMB attacks, which may result in: * The exfiltration of sensitive data such as OS user hashes (NTLM/LM hashes), * In case of misconfigured systems, SMB Relay Attacks which can lead to user impersonation on SMB Shares or, in a worse-case scenario, Remote Code Execution This issue affects all Apache Solr versions prior to 8.11.1. This issue only affects Windows.
CVE-2021-33813	2021-06-16	2023-02-28	7.5	0.07%		Potential	An XXE issue in SAXBuilder in JDOM through 2.0.6 allows attackers to cause a denial of service via a crafted HTTP request.
CVE-2021-29943	2021-04-13	2021-06-08	9.1	5.77%			When using ConfigurableInternodeAuthHadoopPlugin for authentication, Apache Solr versions prior to 8.8.2 would forward/proxy distributed requests using server credentials instead of original client credentials. This would result in incorrect authorization resolution on the receiving hosts.
CVE-2021-29262	2021-04-13	2022-04-01	7.5	26.48%			When starting Apache Solr versions prior to 8.8.2, configured with the SaslZkACLProvider or VMParamsAllAndReadonlyDigestZkACLProvider and no existing security.json znode, if the optional read-only user is configured then Solr would not treat that node as a sensitive path and would allow it to be readable. Additionally, with any ZkACLProvider, if the security.json is already present, Solr will not automatically update the ACLs.
CVE-2021-28163	2021-04-01	2022-05-12	4.0	0.18%		Potential	In Eclipse Jetty 9.4.32 to 9.4.38, 10.0.0.beta2 to 10.0.1, and 11.0.0.beta2 to 11.0.1, if a user uses a webapps directory that is a symlink, the contents of the webapps directory is deployed as a static webapp, inadvertently serving the webapps themselves and anything else that might be in that directory.
CVE-2021-27905	2021-04-13	2021-09-16	9.8	93.98%		Potential	The ReplicationHandler (normally registered at "/replication" under a Solr core) in Apache Solr has a "masterUrl" (also "leaderUrl" alias) parameter that is used to designate another ReplicationHandler on another Solr core to replicate index data into the local core. To prevent a SSRF vulnerability, Solr ought to check these parameters against a similar configuration it uses for the "shards" parameter. Prior to this bug getting fixed, it did not. This problem affects essentially all Solr versions prior to it getting fixed in 8.8.2.
CVE-2020-27223	2021-02-26	2021-09-16	5.3	33.74%		Potential	In Eclipse Jetty 9.4.6.v20170531 to 9.4.36.v20210114 (inclusive), 10.0.0, and 11.0.0 when Jetty handles a request containing multiple Accept headers with a large number of “quality” (i.e. q) parameters, the server may enter a denial of service (DoS) state due to high CPU usage processing those quality values, resulting in minutes of CPU time exhausted processing those quality values.
CVE-2020-13957	2020-10-13	2022-02-22	9.8	84.90%			Apache Solr versions 6.6.0 to 6.6.6, 7.0.0 to 7.7.3 and 8.0.0 to 8.6.2 prevents some features considered dangerous (which could be used for remote code execution) to be configured in a ConfigSet that's uploaded via API without authentication/authorization. The checks in place to prevent such features can be circumvented by using a combination of UPLOAD/CREATE actions.
CVE-2020-13941	2020-08-17	2021-03-25	8.8	2.42%			Reported in SOLR-14515 (private) and fixed in SOLR-14561 (public), released in Solr version 8.6.0. The Replication handler (https://lucene.apache.org/solr/guide/8_6/index-replication.html#http-api-commands-for-the-replicationhandler) allows commands backup, restore and deleteBackup. Each of these take a location parameter, which was not validated, i.e you could read/write to any location the solr user can access.
CVE-2020-9492	2021-01-26	2022-12-06	8.8	0.12%			In Apache Hadoop 3.2.0 to 3.2.1, 3.0.0-alpha1 to 3.1.3, and 2.0.0-alpha to 2.10.0, WebHDFS client might send SPNEGO authorization header to remote URL without proper verification.
CVE-2019-17558	2019-12-30	2025-02-06	7.5	94.47%	2021-11-03	Public	Apache Solr 5.0.0 to Apache Solr 8.3.1 are vulnerable to a Remote Code Execution through the VelocityResponseWriter. A Velocity template can be provided through Velocity templates in a configset `velocity/` directory or as a parameter. A user defined configset could contain renderable, potentially malicious, templates. Parameter provided templates are disabled by default, but can be enabled by setting `params.resource.loader.enabled` by defining a response writer with that setting set to `true`. Defining a response writer requires configuration API access. Solr 8.4 removed the params resource loader entirely, and only enables the configset-provided template rendering when the configset is `trusted` (has been uploaded by an authenticated user).
CVE-2019-12409	2019-11-18	2020-07-23	9.8	83.31%		Potential	The 8.1.1 and 8.2.0 releases of Apache Solr contain an insecure setting for the ENABLE_REMOTE_JMX_OPTS configuration option in the default solr.in.sh configuration file shipping with Solr. If you use the default solr.in.sh file from the affected releases, then JMX monitoring will be enabled and exposed on RMI_PORT (default=18983), without any authentication. If this port is opened for inbound traffic in your firewall, then anyone with network access to your Solr nodes will be able to access JMX, which may in turn allow them to upload malicious code for execution on the Solr server.
CVE-2019-12401	2019-09-10	2023-02-28	7.5	32.77%		Potential	Solr versions 1.3.0 to 1.4.1, 3.1.0 to 3.6.2 and 4.0.0 to 4.10.4 are vulnerable to an XML resource consumption attack (a.k.a. Lol Bomb) via it’s update handler.?By leveraging XML DOCTYPE and ENTITY type elements, the attacker can create a pattern that will expand when the server parses the XML causing OOMs.
CVE-2019-0193	2019-08-01	2025-03-21	9.0	93.61%	2021-12-10	Public	In Apache Solr, the DataImportHandler, an optional but popular module to pull in data from databases and other sources, has a feature in which the whole DIH configuration can come from a request's "dataConfig" parameter. The debug mode of the DIH admin screen uses this to allow convenient debugging / development of a DIH config. Since a DIH config can contain scripts, this parameter is a security risk. Starting with version 8.2.0 of Solr, use of this parameter requires setting the Java System property "enable.dih.dataConfigParam" to true.
CVE-2019-0192	2019-03-07	2020-12-09	9.8	91.99%		Potential	In Apache Solr versions 5.0.0 to 5.5.5 and 6.0.0 to 6.6.5, the Config API allows to configure the JMX server via an HTTP POST request. By pointing it to a malicious RMI server, an attacker could take advantage of Solr's unsafe deserialization to trigger remote code execution on the Solr side.
