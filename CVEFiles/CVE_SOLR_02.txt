CVE-2018-11802	2020-04-01	2020-04-03	4.3	0.17%			In Apache Solr, the cluster can be partitioned into multiple collections and only a subset of nodes actually host any given collection. However, if a node receives a request for a collection it does not host, it proxies the request to a relevant node and serves the request. Solr bypasses all authorization settings for such requests. This affects all Solr versions prior to 7.7 that use the default authorization mechanism of Solr (RuleBasedAuthorizationPlugin).
CVE-2018-8026	2018-07-05	2019-03-29	5.5	8.56%		Potential	This vulnerability in Apache Solr 6.0.0 to 6.6.4 and 7.0.0 to 7.3.1 relates to an XML external entity expansion (XXE) in Solr config files (currency.xml, enumsConfig.xml referred from schema.xml, TIKA parsecontext config file). In addition, Xinclude functionality provided in these config files is also affected in a similar way. The vulnerability can be used as XXE using file/ftp/http protocols in order to read arbitrary local files from the Solr server or the internal network. The manipulated files can be uploaded as configsets using Solr's API, allowing to exploit that vulnerability.
CVE-2018-8010	2018-05-21	2020-03-20	5.5	0.44%			This vulnerability in Apache Solr 6.0.0 to 6.6.3, 7.0.0 to 7.3.0 relates to an XML external entity expansion (XXE) in Solr config files (solrconfig.xml, schema.xml, managed-schema). In addition, Xinclude functionality provided in these config files is also affected in a similar way. The vulnerability can be used as XXE using file/ftp/http protocols in order to read arbitrary local files from the Solr server or the internal network. Users are advised to upgrade to either Solr 6.6.4 or Solr 7.3.1 releases both of which address the vulnerability. Once upgrade is complete, no other steps are required. Those releases only allow external entities and Xincludes that refer to local files / zookeeper resources below the Solr instance directory (using Solr's ResourceLoader); usage of absolute URLs is denied. Keep in mind, that external entities and XInclude are explicitly supported to better structure config files in large installations. Before Solr 6 this was no problem, as config files were not accessible through the APIs.
CVE-2018-1308	2018-04-09	2019-11-12	7.5	2.65%			This vulnerability in Apache Solr 1.2 to 6.6.2 and 7.0.0 to 7.2.1 relates to an XML external entity expansion (XXE) in the `&dataConfig=<inlinexml>` parameter of Solr's DataImportHandler. It can be used as XXE using file/ftp/http protocols in order to read arbitrary local files from the Solr server or the internal network.
CVE-2017-12629	2017-10-14	2022-04-19	9.8	93.89%		Potential	Remote code execution occurs in Apache Solr before 7.1 with Apache Lucene before 7.1 by exploiting XXE in conjunction with use of a Config API add-listener command to reach the RunExecutableListener class. Elasticsearch, although it uses Lucene, is NOT vulnerable to this. Note that the XML external entity expansion vulnerability occurs in the XML Query Parser which is available, by default, for any query request with parameters deftype=xmlparser and can be exploited to upload malicious data to the /upload request handler or as Blind XXE using ftp wrapper in order to read arbitrary local files from the Solr server. Note also that the second vulnerability relates to remote code execution using the RunExecutableListener available on all affected versions of Solr.
CVE-2017-9803	2017-09-18	2019-03-08	7.5	0.34%			Apache Solr's Kerberos plugin can be configured to use delegation tokens, which allows an application to reuse the authentication of an end-user or another application. There are two issues with this functionality (when using SecurityAwareZkACLProvider type of ACL provider e.g. SaslZkACLProvider). Firstly, access to the security configuration can be leaked to users other than the solr super user. Secondly, malicious users can exploit this leaked configuration for privilege escalation to further expose/modify private data and/or disrupt operations in the Solr cluster. The vulnerability is fixed from Apache Solr 6.6.1 onwards.
CVE-2017-7660	2017-07-07	2018-11-28	7.5	1.27%			Apache Solr uses a PKI based mechanism to secure inter-node communication when security is enabled. It is possible to create a specially crafted node name that does not exist as part of the cluster and point it to a malicious node. This can trick the nodes in cluster to believe that the malicious node is a member of the cluster. So, if Solr users have enabled BasicAuth authentication mechanism using the BasicAuthPlugin or if the user has implemented a custom Authentication plugin, which does not implement either "HttpClientInterceptorPlugin" or "HttpClientBuilderPlugin", his/her servers are vulnerable to this attack. Users who only use SSL without basic authentication or those who use Kerberos are not affected.
CVE-2017-3164	2019-03-08	2020-12-09	7.5	48.97%			Server Side Request Forgery in Apache Solr, versions 1.3 until 7.6 (inclusive). Since the "shards" parameter does not have a corresponding whitelist mechanism, a remote attacker with access to the server could make Solr perform an HTTP GET request to any reachable URL.
CVE-2017-3163	2017-08-30	2018-05-17	7.5	3.20%			When using the Index Replication feature, Apache Solr nodes can pull index files from a master/leader node using an HTTP API which accepts a file name. However, Solr before 5.5.4 and 6.x before 6.4.1 did not validate the file name, hence it was possible to craft a special request involving path traversal, leaving any file readable to the Solr server process exposed. Solr servers protected and restricted by firewall rules and/or authentication would not be at risk since only trusted clients and users would gain direct HTTP access.
CVE-2015-8797	2016-02-15	2025-04-12	6.1	2.07%			Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in webapp/web/js/scripts/plugins.js in the stats page in the Admin UI in Apache Solr before 5.3.1 allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the entry parameter to a plugins/cache URI.
CVE-2015-8796	2016-02-15	2025-04-12	6.1	2.55%			Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in webapp/web/js/scripts/schema-browser.js in the Admin UI in Apache Solr before 5.3 allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via a crafted schema-browse URL.
CVE-2015-8795	2016-02-15	2025-04-12	6.1	2.56%			Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in the Admin UI in Apache Solr before 5.1 allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via crafted fields that are mishandled during the rendering of the (1) Analysis page, related to webapp/web/js/scripts/analysis.js or (2) Schema-Browser page, related to webapp/web/js/scripts/schema-browser.js.
CVE-2014-3628	2015-01-06	2025-04-12	4.3	2.44%			Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Admin UI Plugin / Stats page in Apache Solr 4.x before 4.10.3 allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the fieldvaluecache object.
CVE-2013-6408	2013-12-07	2025-04-11	6.4	4.10%			The DocumentAnalysisRequestHandler in Apache Solr before 4.3.1 does not properly use the EmptyEntityResolver, which allows remote attackers to have an unspecified impact via XML data containing an external entity declaration in conjunction with an entity reference, related to an XML External Entity (XXE) issue.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2013-6407.
CVE-2013-6407	2013-12-07	2025-04-11	6.4	4.10%			The UpdateRequestHandler for XML in Apache Solr before 4.1 allows remote attackers to have an unspecified impact via XML data containing an external entity declaration in conjunction with an entity reference, related to an XML External Entity (XXE) issue.
CVE-2013-6397	2013-12-07	2025-04-11	4.3	93.35%		Potential	Directory traversal vulnerability in SolrResourceLoader in Apache Solr before 4.6 allows remote attackers to read arbitrary files via a .. (dot dot) or full pathname in the tr parameter to solr/select/, when the response writer (wt parameter) is set to XSLT.  NOTE: this can be leveraged using a separate XXE (XML eXternal Entity) vulnerability to allow access to files across restricted network boundaries.
CVE-2012-6612	2013-12-07	2025-04-11	7.5	1.28%			The (1) UpdateRequestHandler for XSLT or (2) XPathEntityProcessor in Apache Solr before 4.1 allows remote attackers to have an unspecified impact via XML data containing an external entity declaration in conjunction with an entity reference, related to an XML External Entity (XXE) issue, different vectors than CVE-2013-6407.
CVE-2009-3821	2009-10-28	2025-04-09	4.3	1.51%			Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Apache Solr Search (solr) extension 1.0.0 for TYPO3 allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via unspecified vectors.
