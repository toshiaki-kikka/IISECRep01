CVE	Published	Last Update	Max CVSS Base Score	EPSS Score	CISA KEV Added	Public Exploit Exists	Summary
CVE-2023-45853	2023-10-14	2024-12-20	9.8	0.39%			MiniZip in zlib through 1.3 has an integer overflow and resultant heap-based buffer overflow in zipOpenNewFileInZip4_64 via a long filename, comment, or extra field. NOTE: MiniZip is not a supported part of the zlib product. NOTE: pyminizip through 0.2.6 is also vulnerable because it bundles an affected zlib version, and exposes the applicable MiniZip code through its compress API.
CVE-2022-37434	2022-08-05	2023-07-19	9.8	92.74%		Potential	zlib through 1.2.12 has a heap-based buffer over-read or buffer overflow in inflate in inflate.c via a large gzip header extra field. NOTE: only applications that call inflateGetHeader are affected. Some common applications bundle the affected zlib source code but may be unable to call inflateGetHeader (e.g., see the nodejs/node reference).
CVE-2018-25032	2022-03-25	2025-03-28	7.5	0.11%		Potential	zlib before 1.2.12 allows memory corruption when deflating (i.e., when compressing) if the input has many distant matches.
CVE-2016-9843	2017-05-23	2022-08-16	9.8	9.23%		Potential	The crc32_big function in crc32.c in zlib 1.2.8 might allow context-dependent attackers to have unspecified impact via vectors involving big-endian CRC calculation.
CVE-2016-9842	2017-05-23	2024-08-28	8.8	10.32%		Potential	The inflateMark function in inflate.c in zlib 1.2.8 might allow context-dependent attackers to have unspecified impact via vectors involving left shifts of negative integers.
CVE-2016-9841	2017-05-23	2022-08-16	9.8	18.98%		Potential	inffast.c in zlib 1.2.8 might allow context-dependent attackers to have unspecified impact by leveraging improper pointer arithmetic.
CVE-2016-9840	2017-05-23	2025-03-28	8.8	12.08%		Potential	inftrees.c in zlib 1.2.8 might allow context-dependent attackers to have unspecified impact by leveraging improper pointer arithmetic.
CVE-2015-1191	2015-01-21	2025-04-12	5.0	0.90%		Potential	Multiple directory traversal vulnerabilities in pigz 2.3.1 allow remote attackers to write to arbitrary files via a (1) full pathname or (2) .. (dot dot) in an archive.
CVE-2013-0296	2014-04-27	2025-04-12	4.4	0.05%			Race condition in pigz before 2.2.5 uses permissions derived from the umask when compressing a file before setting that file's permissions to match those of the original file, which might allow local users to bypass intended access permissions while compression is occurring.
CVE-2005-2096	2005-07-06	2025-04-03	7.5	48.84%			zlib 1.2 and later versions allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via a crafted compressed stream with an incomplete code description of a length greater than 1, which leads to a buffer overflow, as demonstrated using a crafted PNG file.
CVE-2005-1849	2005-07-26	2025-04-03	5.0	8.60%			inftrees.h in zlib 1.2.2 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) via an invalid file that causes a large dynamic tree to be produced.
CVE-2004-0797	2004-10-20	2025-04-03	2.1	1.71%			The error handling in the (1) inflate and (2) inflateBack functions in ZLib compression library 1.2.x allows local users to cause a denial of service (application crash).
CVE-2003-0107	2003-03-07	2025-04-03	7.5	23.10%		Potential	Buffer overflow in the gzprintf function in zlib 1.1.4, when zlib is compiled without vsnprintf or when long inputs are truncated using vsnprintf, allows attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code.
CVE-2002-0059	2002-03-15	2025-04-03	9.8	29.93%			The decompression algorithm in zlib 1.1.3 and earlier, as used in many different utilities and packages, causes inflateEnd to release certain memory more than once (a "double free"), which may allow local and remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a block of malformed compression data.
