CVE	Published	Last Update	Max CVSS Base Score	EPSS Score	CISA KEV Added	Public Exploit Exists	Summary
CVE-2020-11993	2020-08-07	2021-06-06	7.5	77.98%		Potential	Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.20 to 2.4.43 When trace/debug was enabled for the HTTP/2 module and on certain traffic edge patterns, logging statements were made on the wrong connection, causing concurrent use of memory pools. Configuring the LogLevel of mod_http2 above "info" will mitigate this vulnerability for unpatched servers.
CVE-2020-11985	2020-08-07	2021-06-06	5.3	16.61%			IP address spoofing when proxying using mod_remoteip and mod_rewrite For configurations using proxying with mod_remoteip and certain mod_rewrite rules, an attacker could spoof their IP address for logging and PHP scripts. Note this issue was fixed in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.24 but was retrospectively allocated a low severity CVE in 2020.
CVE-2020-11984	2020-08-07	2021-06-06	9.8	48.11%		Potential	Apache HTTP server 2.4.32 to 2.4.44 mod_proxy_uwsgi info disclosure and possible RCE
CVE-2020-9490	2020-08-07	2022-10-07	7.5	75.82%			Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.20 to 2.4.43. A specially crafted value for the 'Cache-Digest' header in a HTTP/2 request would result in a crash when the server actually tries to HTTP/2 PUSH a resource afterwards. Configuring the HTTP/2 feature via "H2Push off" will mitigate this vulnerability for unpatched servers.
CVE-2020-1934	2020-04-01	2022-04-26	5.3	38.08%			In Apache HTTP Server 2.4.0 to 2.4.41, mod_proxy_ftp may use uninitialized memory when proxying to a malicious FTP server.
CVE-2020-1927	2020-04-02	2022-07-25	6.1	15.49%			In Apache HTTP Server 2.4.0 to 2.4.41, redirects configured with mod_rewrite that were intended to be self-referential might be fooled by encoded newlines and redirect instead to an an unexpected URL within the request URL.
CVE-2019-17567	2021-06-10	2024-06-10	5.3	9.56%			Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.6 to 2.4.46 mod_proxy_wstunnel configured on an URL that is not necessarily Upgraded by the origin server was tunneling the whole connection regardless, thus allowing for subsequent requests on the same connection to pass through with no HTTP validation, authentication or authorization possibly configured.
CVE-2019-10098	2019-09-25	2021-06-14	6.1	79.25%			In Apache HTTP server 2.4.0 to 2.4.39, Redirects configured with mod_rewrite that were intended to be self-referential might be fooled by encoded newlines and redirect instead to an unexpected URL within the request URL.
CVE-2019-10097	2019-09-26	2021-07-07	7.2	30.17%			In Apache HTTP Server 2.4.32-2.4.39, when mod_remoteip was configured to use a trusted intermediary proxy server using the "PROXY" protocol, a specially crafted PROXY header could trigger a stack buffer overflow or NULL pointer deference. This vulnerability could only be triggered by a trusted proxy and not by untrusted HTTP clients.
CVE-2019-10092	2019-09-26	2021-09-09	6.1	84.15%		Potential	In Apache HTTP Server 2.4.0-2.4.39, a limited cross-site scripting issue was reported affecting the mod_proxy error page. An attacker could cause the link on the error page to be malformed and instead point to a page of their choice. This would only be exploitable where a server was set up with proxying enabled but was misconfigured in such a way that the Proxy Error page was displayed.
CVE-2019-10082	2019-09-26	2022-07-25	9.1	41.33%			In Apache HTTP Server 2.4.18-2.4.39, using fuzzed network input, the http/2 session handling could be made to read memory after being freed, during connection shutdown.
CVE-2019-10081	2019-08-15	2021-06-06	7.5	21.48%		Potential	HTTP/2 (2.4.20 through 2.4.39) very early pushes, for example configured with "H2PushResource", could lead to an overwrite of memory in the pushing request's pool, leading to crashes. The memory copied is that of the configured push link header values, not data supplied by the client.
CVE-2019-9517	2019-08-13	2025-01-14	7.8	4.56%			Some HTTP/2 implementations are vulnerable to unconstrained interal data buffering, potentially leading to a denial of service. The attacker opens the HTTP/2 window so the peer can send without constraint; however, they leave the TCP window closed so the peer cannot actually write (many of) the bytes on the wire. The attacker then sends a stream of requests for a large response object. Depending on how the servers queue the responses, this can consume excess memory, CPU, or both.
CVE-2019-0220	2019-06-11	2022-07-25	5.3	17.93%			A vulnerability was found in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.0 to 2.4.38. When the path component of a request URL contains multiple consecutive slashes ('/'), directives such as LocationMatch and RewriteRule must account for duplicates in regular expressions while other aspects of the servers processing will implicitly collapse them.
CVE-2019-0217	2019-04-08	2021-06-06	7.5	42.32%			In Apache HTTP Server 2.4 release 2.4.38 and prior, a race condition in mod_auth_digest when running in a threaded server could allow a user with valid credentials to authenticate using another username, bypassing configured access control restrictions.
CVE-2019-0215	2019-04-08	2021-06-06	7.5	10.60%		Potential	In Apache HTTP Server 2.4 releases 2.4.37 and 2.4.38, a bug in mod_ssl when using per-location client certificate verification with TLSv1.3 allowed a client to bypass configured access control restrictions.
CVE-2019-0211	2019-04-08	2025-04-04	7.8	83.46%	2021-11-03	Public	In Apache HTTP Server 2.4 releases 2.4.17 to 2.4.38, with MPM event, worker or prefork, code executing in less-privileged child processes or threads (including scripts executed by an in-process scripting interpreter) could execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the parent process (usually root) by manipulating the scoreboard. Non-Unix systems are not affected.
CVE-2019-0197	2019-06-11	2022-09-07	4.9	2.23%			A vulnerability was found in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.34 to 2.4.38. When HTTP/2 was enabled for a http: host or H2Upgrade was enabled for h2 on a https: host, an Upgrade request from http/1.1 to http/2 that was not the first request on a connection could lead to a misconfiguration and crash. Server that never enabled the h2 protocol or that only enabled it for https: and did not set "H2Upgrade on" are unaffected by this issue.
CVE-2019-0196	2019-06-11	2021-06-06	5.3	8.20%			A vulnerability was found in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.17 to 2.4.38. Using fuzzed network input, the http/2 request handling could be made to access freed memory in string comparison when determining the method of a request and thus process the request incorrectly.
CVE-2019-0190	2019-01-30	2021-07-20	7.5	17.68%			A bug exists in the way mod_ssl handled client renegotiations. A remote attacker could send a carefully crafted request that would cause mod_ssl to enter a loop leading to a denial of service. This bug can be only triggered with Apache HTTP Server version 2.4.37 when using OpenSSL version 1.1.1 or later, due to an interaction in changes to handling of renegotiation attempts.
CVE-2018-17199	2019-01-30	2021-06-06	7.5	5.65%			In Apache HTTP Server 2.4 release 2.4.37 and prior, mod_session checks the session expiry time before decoding the session. This causes session expiry time to be ignored for mod_session_cookie sessions since the expiry time is loaded when the session is decoded.
CVE-2018-17189	2019-01-30	2021-07-06	5.3	4.92%			In Apache HTTP server versions 2.4.37 and prior, by sending request bodies in a slow loris way to plain resources, the h2 stream for that request unnecessarily occupied a server thread cleaning up that incoming data. This affects only HTTP/2 (mod_http2) connections.
CVE-2018-11763	2018-09-25	2021-06-06	5.9	19.17%			In Apache HTTP Server 2.4.17 to 2.4.34, by sending continuous, large SETTINGS frames a client can occupy a connection, server thread and CPU time without any connection timeout coming to effect. This affects only HTTP/2 connections. A possible mitigation is to not enable the h2 protocol.
CVE-2018-8011	2018-07-18	2021-06-06	7.5	39.73%			By specially crafting HTTP requests, the mod_md challenge handler would dereference a NULL pointer and cause the child process to segfault. This could be used to DoS the server. Fixed in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.34 (Affected 2.4.33).
CVE-2018-1333	2018-06-18	2021-06-06	7.5	16.31%			By specially crafting HTTP/2 requests, workers would be allocated 60 seconds longer than necessary, leading to worker exhaustion and a denial of service. Fixed in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.34 (Affected 2.4.18-2.4.30,2.4.33).
