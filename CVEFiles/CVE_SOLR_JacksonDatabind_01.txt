CVE	Published	Last Update	Max CVSS Base Score	EPSS Score	CISA KEV Added	Public Exploit Exists	Summary
CVE-2023-35116	2023-06-14	2024-08-02	4.7	0.02%		Potential	jackson-databind through 2.15.2 allows attackers to cause a denial of service or other unspecified impact via a crafted object that uses cyclic dependencies. NOTE: the vendor's perspective is that this is not a valid vulnerability report, because the steps of constructing a cyclic data structure and trying to serialize it cannot be achieved by an external attacker.

An application is vulnerable only with certain customized choices for deserialization.
CVE-2022-42003	2022-10-02	2023-12-20	7.5	0.17%		Potential	In FasterXML jackson-databind before versions 2.13.4.1 and 2.12.17.1, resource exhaustion can occur because of a lack of a check in primitive value deserializers to avoid deep wrapper array nesting, when the UNWRAP_SINGLE_VALUE_ARRAYS feature is enabled.
