CVE-2016-0702	2016-03-03	2025-04-12	5.1	0.49%			The MOD_EXP_CTIME_COPY_FROM_PREBUF function in crypto/bn/bn_exp.c in OpenSSL 1.0.1 before 1.0.1s and 1.0.2 before 1.0.2g does not properly consider cache-bank access times during modular exponentiation, which makes it easier for local users to discover RSA keys by running a crafted application on the same Intel Sandy Bridge CPU core as a victim and leveraging cache-bank conflicts, aka a "CacheBleed" attack.
CVE-2016-0701	2016-02-15	2025-04-12	3.7	24.99%			The DH_check_pub_key function in crypto/dh/dh_check.c in OpenSSL 1.0.2 before 1.0.2f does not ensure that prime numbers are appropriate for Diffie-Hellman (DH) key exchange, which makes it easier for remote attackers to discover a private DH exponent by making multiple handshakes with a peer that chose an inappropriate number, as demonstrated by a number in an X9.42 file.
CVE-2015-4000	2015-05-21	2025-04-12	4.3	94.03%		Public	The TLS protocol 1.2 and earlier, when a DHE_EXPORT ciphersuite is enabled on a server but not on a client, does not properly convey a DHE_EXPORT choice, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to conduct cipher-downgrade attacks by rewriting a ClientHello with DHE replaced by DHE_EXPORT and then rewriting a ServerHello with DHE_EXPORT replaced by DHE, aka the "Logjam" issue.
CVE-2015-3216	2015-07-07	2025-04-12	4.3	1.36%			Race condition in a certain Red Hat patch to the PRNG lock implementation in the ssleay_rand_bytes function in OpenSSL, as distributed in openssl-1.0.1e-25.el7 in Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 7 and other products, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) by establishing many TLS sessions to a multithreaded server, leading to use of a negative value for a certain length field.
CVE-2015-3197	2016-02-15	2025-04-12	5.9	18.22%			ssl/s2_srvr.c in OpenSSL 1.0.1 before 1.0.1r and 1.0.2 before 1.0.2f does not prevent use of disabled ciphers, which makes it easier for man-in-the-middle attackers to defeat cryptographic protection mechanisms by performing computations on SSLv2 traffic, related to the get_client_master_key and get_client_hello functions.

CVE-2015-3195	2015-12-06	2025-04-12	5.3	2.07%			The ASN1_TFLG_COMBINE implementation in crypto/asn1/tasn_dec.c in OpenSSL before 0.9.8zh, 1.0.0 before 1.0.0t, 1.0.1 before 1.0.1q, and 1.0.2 before 1.0.2e mishandles errors caused by malformed X509_ATTRIBUTE data, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information from process memory by triggering a decoding failure in a PKCS#7 or CMS application.
CVE-2015-3194	2015-12-06	2025-04-12	7.5	57.95%			crypto/rsa/rsa_ameth.c in OpenSSL 1.0.1 before 1.0.1q and 1.0.2 before 1.0.2e allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and application crash) via an RSA PSS ASN.1 signature that lacks a mask generation function parameter.
CVE-2015-3193	2015-12-06	2025-04-12	7.5	20.21%			The Montgomery squaring implementation in crypto/bn/asm/x86_64-mont5.pl in OpenSSL 1.0.2 before 1.0.2e on the x86_64 platform, as used by the BN_mod_exp function, mishandles carry propagation and produces incorrect output, which makes it easier for remote attackers to obtain sensitive private-key information via an attack against use of a (1) Diffie-Hellman (DH) or (2) Diffie-Hellman Ephemeral (DHE) ciphersuite.
CVE-2015-1794	2015-12-06	2025-04-12	5.0	5.22%			The ssl3_get_key_exchange function in ssl/s3_clnt.c in OpenSSL 1.0.2 before 1.0.2e allows remote servers to cause a denial of service (segmentation fault) via a zero p value in an anonymous Diffie-Hellman (DH) ServerKeyExchange message.
